  Magit is an interface to the version control system
  <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a>, implemented as an
  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs">Emacs</a> package.
  Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain.  While we cannot
  (yet) claim that Magit wraps and improves upon each and every Git
  command, it is complete enough to allow even experienced Git users
  to perform almost all of their daily version control tasks directly
  from within Emacs.  While many fine Git clients exist, only Magit
  and Git itself deserve to be called porcelains.

  Please consider supporting the ongoing
  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1681258897/its-magit-the-magical-git-client?ref=ewctvn">
  crowd-funding campaign</a>.  If it succeeds, then I can work full-time
  on Magit for a whole year.  I am still overflowing with ideas, and
  depend on your support to realize them, and to address the remaining
  long-standing issues.  It is great that many users already consider
  Magit to be one of Emacs' killer applications, but it is still far
  from fulfilling its true potential.  Only with your help can I get it
  there.
