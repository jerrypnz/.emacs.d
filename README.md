#Graphene Meta-Theme
This theme works with any other active theme to provide a pleasing default look.
It does not provide new interface colours but rather re-uses the theming
of Emacs built-ins to integrate the overall look of several common or
built-in packages. It should be loaded *after* any theme you normally
use to set the interface colours of your Emacs.
