## Description

This is a package for GNU Emacs that allows you to define major mode
specific [hydra
heads](https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra#awesome-head-1). They get
compiled to nice-looking hydras and you can bring them up with a
leader key. It's inspired by [Spacemacs major mode leader
key](http://spacemacs.org/doc/DOCUMENTATION.html#major-mode-leader-key)
and is based on the awesome [hydra](https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra)
package.
