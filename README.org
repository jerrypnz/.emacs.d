* My Emacs Config

  My personal emacs config using [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] to manage packages and
  =use-package= to structure configuration.

  You really shouldn't use it as is but you may find somethings below
  interesting or useful:

  - [[lisp/jp-main-hydra.el][Main hydra]]: I use hydra for a leader key system similar to
    Spacemacs' =SPC= leader key but looks a bit prettier thanks to
    [[https://github.com/jerrypnz/major-mode-hydra.el#pretty-hydra][pretty-hydra]] and [[https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el][all-the-icons]].

  - [[lisp/jp-modeline.el][Mode/header line]]: The current header line is inspired by
    [[https://github.com/rougier/elegant-emacs][elegant-emacs]] but the customization is based on
    [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes][doom-emacs-themes]]. My customization can be found in
    [[lisp/jp-themes.el][lisp/jp-themes.el]].

  - [[lisp/jp-layouts.el][Workspace layouts]]: This is a simple project based workspace system
    based on [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]], [[https://github.com/wasamasa/eyebrowse][eyebrowse]] and a hydra for the user
    interface. I use this feature a lot so I added part of this hydra
    to my main dispatcher for quickly switching between project
    layouts.
