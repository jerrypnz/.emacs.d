# List Cases

Indentation is described in terms of four components: the position of
the beginning of the block, the actual indentation of the block (first
line), in terms of spaces, followed by whether the block begins with a
list marker, and the list level.


## Case 1

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do
eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

   Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris
   nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

 Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse
 cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui
officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

*Indentation:* (273 0 nil 0) (399 3 nil 0) (514 1 nil 0) (620 0 nil 0)

*Notes:* These are all just normal paragraphs, since there are no list
markers or blocks indented at least four spaces.


## Case 2

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do
eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

- Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris
  nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo a consequat.

 Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse
cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

- Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui
officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

*Indentation:* (931 0 nil 0) (1063 0 t 1) (1178 1 nil 1) (1283 0 t 1)

*Notes:* Even though the third block is only indented one space, it is
indented one more space than the list marker, so it becomes a second
paragraph within the first list item.


## Case 3

+ This is a list item with
no leading indentation and
no hanging indent.

    A four-space indented block that follows
    is parsed as a paragraph within the list item.

+ Second list item

*Indentation:* (1659 0 t 1) (1733 4 nil 1) (1830 0 t 1)


## Case 4

* This is a list item with
  no leading indentation and
  a hanging indent.

    A four-space indented block that follows
    is parsed as a paragraph within the list item.

*Indentation:* (1919 0 t 1) (1996 4 nil 1)


## Case 5

 * This is a list item with
single space leading indentation and
no hanging indentation.

    A four-space indented block that follows
    is parsed as a paragraph within the list item.

*Indentation:* (2149 1 t 1) (2239 4 nil 1)


## Case 6

 * This is a list item with
single space leading indentation and
no hanging indentation.

  * A list item with two-space indent
  starts a new list level.

    A four-space indented block that follows
    is parsed as a paragraph within the **first-level**
    list item.  Why not the second level?

*Indentation:* (2392 2 t 1) (2482 2 t 2) (2548 4 nil 1)


## Case 7

 * This is a list item with
single space leading indentation and
no hanging indentation.

  * A list item with two-space indent
  starts a new list level.

  A two-space indented block that follows
  is parsed as a paragraph within the **first-level**
  list item.

*Indentation:* (2761 1 t 1) (2851 2 t 2) (2917 2 nil 2)


## Case 8

 * This is a list item with
single space leading indentation and
no hanging indentation.

  * A list item with two-space indent
  starts a new list level.

     A five-space indented block that follows is parsed as a
     paragraph within the *second* list item.  This indentation
     exceeds that required for the first item.

            Finally, to get a pre block, we have to use 12 spaces.
            That's the third level of four-space indentation.
            We have to exceed the list level, which is two.

*Indentation:* (3096 1 t 1) (3186 2 t 2) (3252 5 nil 2) (3425 12 nil 2)


## Case 9

-   This is a list item with two paragraphs.

    This is the second paragraph in the list item. You're
only required to indent the first line. Lorem ipsum dolor
sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.

*   Another item in the same list.

*Indentation:* (3700 0 t 1) (3746 4 nil 1) (3903 0 t 1)


## Case 10

*   A list item with a blockquote:

    > This is a blockquote
    > inside a list item.

*Indentation:* (4009 0 t 1) (4045 4 nil 1)
