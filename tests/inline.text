This is *italic.*
This is **bold.**
This is `code`.
This is ``code`containing`backticks``.

Seven backquotes in a row ``````` do not constitute a code span.

If backquotes begin or end a code span, you have to use spaces,
like `` `this` ``.  Markdown removes any leading and trailing
whitespace. Only the space a the end is necessary,
like ```this` ``.

A backslash as the final character in an inline code fragment does
*not* escape the backquote.  That is, `C-h C-\` will render as

    <code>C-h C-\</code>

However, we can escape what would otherwise be a leading backquote,
as in \`foo\` or \`bar\`.

But this will be a code span crossing lines: \`foo` or
bar ` containing only "or bar".

This should result in three backquotes in a code span `` ``` `` and
they should even match across across lines `` ```
``, like so.  However, backquotes should not `` ``` match

across two blocks``.
