## Installation

The recommended way to install Projectile is via `package.el`.

### package.el

#### MELPA

You can install a snapshot version of Projectile from the
[MELPA](http://melpa.org) repository. The version of
Projectile there will always be up-to-date, but it might be unstable
(albeit rarely).

#### MELPA Stable

You can install the last stable version of Projectile from the
[MELPA Stable](http://stable.melpa.org) repository.

### el-get

Projectile is also available for installation from the [el-get](https://github.com/dimitri/el-get) package manager.

### Emacs Prelude

Projectile is naturally part of the
[Emacs Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude). If you're a Prelude
user - Projectile is already properly configured and ready for
action.

### Debian and Ubuntu

Users of Debian 9 or later or Ubuntu 16.10 or later may simply
`apt-get install elpa-projectile`.
