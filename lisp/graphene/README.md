# Graphene
Graphene is a 'starter kit' for Emacs, in the vein of
[Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) or
[emacs-starter-kit](https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit).

It provides:
- Some sensible defaults
- A clean look
- The basics you need to make Emacs functionality discoverable
- A set of third-party packages that set the standard for the
  essential functionality they provide
- Some plumbing to make the above 'just work', seamlessly and silently

Although Graphene is intended to help users of GUI editors such as
Textmate or Sublime Text find their feet quickly, it is not an attempt
to turn Emacs into a sparkly GUI editor or IDE. It is minimal,
lightweight, and respectful of the history and character of Emacs.

# News
Graphene 0.9 depends on [project-persist-drawer](https://github.com/rdallasgray/project-persist-drawer) and [ppd-sr-speedbar](https://github.com/rdallasgray/ppd-sr-speedbar) to hook a drawer into project activity.

Custom variables are extended and refined -- see the relevant info documentation in the `graphene` group.

## Sensible defaults
Among many other things, Graphene turns off the Emacs startup screen,
turns on
[line wrapping](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/VisualLineMode), turns
off the scroll bars and tool bar (and menu bar on non-OS X systems),
moves automatic backups into the temp directory -- generally clears
the way of small annoyances and makes things look and work the way
you'd expect.

## A clean look
Graphene includes its own 'meta-theme' which works hard to unify the
look of the editor across a range of packages. This theme loads on top
of any 'normal' theme you want to load, so you can still choose
exactly how you want your Emacs to look.

It also sets more pleasant and modern default fonts appropriate to the
host platform (which can be overridden), and maintains window size and
position across sessions.

## Discoverability
At first Emacs can appear a little opaque; it is in fact a very
discoverable environment, and Graphene tries to turn this up to
maximum, by using
[Ido](http://emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings) everywhere,
[Smex](http://www.emacswiki.org/Smex) for running extended commands,
and [Company](http://company-mode.github.io) for in-editor
completion. These allow gradual discovery of Emacs' functionality, and
gradual building of speed and fluidity.

## Essential packages
The collection of packages Graphene includes prevents you having to
research and discover on your own what the Emacs community has largely
decided on as best-in-class packages.

- [project-persist](https://github.com/rdallasgray/project-persist)
  Disclaimer: this is my own project, and is perhaps the exception to the
  above rule. It provides simple project loading and saving;
  Graphene adds a project 'drawer' using
  [Sr-Speedbar](https://github.com/emacsmirror/sr-speedbar)
- [Smartparens](https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens)
  For auto-pairing
- [Company](http://company-mode.github.io)
  For code completion
- [Web-mode](https://github.com/fxbois/web-mode)
  For mixed-mode editing
- [Smex](http://www.emacswiki.org/Smex)
  For command completion
- [Ido](http://emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings)
  For general completion
- [Flycheck](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck)
  For error checking

## Installation
Graphene is available on [Melpa](http://melpa.org).

If you don't already have your Emacs set up to use the package
installation system, let me gently point you to
[Pallet](https://github.com/rdallasgray/pallet).

Anyway -- your default initialisation file is in (old-school)
`~/.emacs` or (new-school, and where it *should* be)
`~/.emacs.d/init.el`. First, you need to set up the Emacs package
system and tell it about Melpa, so create one of those files if it
doesn't already exist, and add these lines to the file:

```
;; Require Emacs' package functionality
(require 'package)

;; Add the Melpa repository to the list of package sources
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)

;; Initialise the package system.
(package-initialize)
```

Then either select those lines and do `M-x eval-region`, or restart
Emacs. After that, do `M-x list-packages`, search for
'graphene' (either manually or using `C-s`), mark it for installation
by pressing 'i', and install it by pressing 'x'.

It will take a while to install itself and its various dependencies, and will
probably raise a few compilation issues. You can probably safely ignore
these. Once it's done, add this to your initialisation file:

```
(require 'graphene)
```
Restart Emacs, and away you go.

## How do I ... ?
All of the packages Graphene includes are well-documented, and I'll
refer you to them rather than retread that documentation here. That
said, there are some Graphene-specific things you need to know.

### Keybindings
Graphene creates some new keybindings, and alters some existing ones:

- `C-x k` always kills the active buffer, rather than asking you which
  one you want to kill
- `C-x C-k` kills the default buffer and closes its window
- `C-c n` creates a new buffer
- `C-c N` creates a new instance of Emacs
- `C-;` adds a semicolon at the end of the line
- `M-RET` creates a newline below the current line and moves to it
- `C-M-;` comments or uncomments the current line
- `C->` increases the height of the current window
- `C-<` decreases it
- `C-.` increases the width of the current window
- `C-,` decreases it
- `C-c s` selects the Speedbar window

Graphene used to bind the standard Mac keys for various purposes
(Command-n for new buffer, for instance), but no longer does.

### Projects
[project-persist](https://github.com/rdallasgray/project-persist) uses
the following keybindings:

- `C-c P n` to create a new project
- `C-c P f` to find an existing project
- `C-c P k` to close the current project
- `C-c P d` to delete an existing project

### Customising
Try `M-x customize-group` and type 'graphene', for an idea of what can
be customised; you may wish to set these programmatically in your init
file, instead.

## Contributions and feedback
Contributions to Graphene are very welcome, as are feedback and bug
reports. The latter can be raised via the Issues section.

To contribute code, fork and clone the repo. If you want to be able to
build the package, run `git submodule update --init`,
which will install [el.mk](http://github.com/rdallasgray/el.mk), then
[install Cask](https://github.com/cask/cask) and run `cask install`.

When you've created your feature, make a pull request against master
in this repo.
