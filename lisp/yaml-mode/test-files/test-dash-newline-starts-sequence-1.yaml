# Old behaviour (version 0.0.12)
#
# (1) Move to cursor to the beginning of the line containing 'aaa'
# (2) Press TAB
# (3) The line should be indented now.
# Problem: the line is not indented.
#
# Note: in the line containing the dash ('-') there is no space character
# after the dash, so it is not recognized as start of the sequence entry
# by yaml-nested-sequence-re
#
# Proposed change:
#
# Change yaml-bare-scalar-re to recognize the dash-newline sequence.
#
# New behaviour:
#
#    (1) Pressing TAB on the line containing 'aaa' now indents the line.
#    (2) Pressing TAB again unindents the line.
