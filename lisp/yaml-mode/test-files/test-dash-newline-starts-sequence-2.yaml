# Old behaviour (version 0.0.12)
#
# (1) Move to cursor to the beginning of the line containing 'aaa'
# (2) Press TAB repeatedly
#
# (3) The cycle of indentations of the line should include
#     the 'indented more than the previous line' state
#
# Problem: the line is only indented to align with
#   the dash in then previous line, but not more.
#
# Note: in the line containing the dash ('-') there is no space character
# after the dash, so it is not recognized as start of the sequence entry
# by yaml-nested-sequence-re
#
# Proposed change:
#
# Change yaml-bare-scalar-re to recognize the dash-newline sequence.
#
# New behaviour:
#
#    (1) Pressing TAB on the line containing 'aaa'
#        now indents the line more than the previous line.
#
#    (2) Pressing TAB again indents the line
#        to align with dash on the previous line.
#
#    (3) Pressing TAB again unindents the line.
