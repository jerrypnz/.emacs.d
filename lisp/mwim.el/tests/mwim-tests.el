;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides some tests to check that the point appears on the
;; right positions after calling MWIM commands.
;;
;; These tests can be run like this:
;;
;;   cd /path/to/mwim
;;   emacs -Q -nw -L . --batch --eval '(progn (load-file "tests/mwim-tests.el") (ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit))'
