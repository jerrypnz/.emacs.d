;; Add commands to move border

;; window resizing functions

;;; Code:

(defun xor (b1 b2)
  (or (and b1 b2)
      (and (not b1) (not b2))))

(defun move-border-left-or-right (arg dir)
  "General function covering move-border-left and move-border-right. If DIR is
     t, then move left, otherwise move right."
  (interactive)
  (if (null arg) (setq arg 3))
  (let ((left-edge (nth 0 (window-edges))))
    (if (xor (= left-edge 0) dir)
        (shrink-window arg t)
      (enlarge-window arg t))))

(defun move-border-up-or-down (arg dir)
  "General function covering move-border-up and move-border-down. If DIR is
     t, then move up, otherwise move down."
