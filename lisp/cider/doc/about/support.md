CIDER currently has several official & unofficial support channels.

For questions, suggestions and support refer to one of them.  Please, don't
use the support channels to report issues, as this makes them harder to track.

## Mailing list

The [official mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cider-emacs) is
hosted at Google Groups. It's a low-traffic list, so don't be too hesitant to subscribe.

## Freenode

We've got an unofficial Freenode channel - `#clojure-emacs`. It's not actively
monitored by the CIDER maintainers themselves, but still you can get support
from other CIDER users there.

## Slack

We've got an official [Clojurians Slack](https://clojurians.slack.com/) -
`#cider`. This is usually be best way to get a handle on some of the maintainers
and interact with other CIDER users. The channel is very active!

There's also another channel named `#emacs` for generic Emacs discussions.

## Gitter

Most internal discussions about the development of CIDER happen on its
[gitter channel](https://gitter.im/clojure-emacs/cider).  You can often find
CIDER's maintainers there and get some interesting news from the project's
kitchen.

## Stackoverflow

We're also encouraging users to ask CIDER-related questions on StackOverflow.

When doing so you should use the
[cider](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cider) tag (ideally combined
with the tags `emacs` and `clojure`).

## Bountysource

If you're willing to pay for some feature to be implemented you can use
[Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/cider/issues) to place a
bounty for the work you want to be done.
