htmlize NEWS -- history of user-visible changes.

* Changes in htmlize 1.51

** `htmlize-face-overrides' can be used to override Emacs's face
definitions.


* Changes in htmlize 1.47

** GNU Emacs 21 is no longer supported.


* Changes in htmlize 1.45

** Correctly handle :inherit specifying a list of faces.  (This bug
would cause an error in AUX TeX buffers.)


* Changes in htmlize 1.44

** Faces specified in the `face' property are now prioritized the same
way that Emacs redisplay does it: faces that appear earlier have
precedence over those that appear later.


* Changes in htmlize 1.41

** `before-string' and `after-string' overlay properties are now
recognized by htmlize and inserted into the HTML.

** Images specified by `display' property are recognized and inserted
into the HTML as <img src=...>.

*** If the image data comes from a file, the image will be rendered as
a relative URI that would resolve to that file.  Images whose data
comes from a string will be rendered inline as data: URIs.  The flag
`htmlize-force-inline-images' can be used to force inserting *all*
images inline as data: URIs.

** The image's ALT text will be the text that the `display' property is
replacing, if non-empty.

** Arbitrary links can now be added to the generated HTML.  If htmlize
encounters buffer text with `htmlize-link' property, it will wrap the
text in <a href="uri">...</a>.  If the property value is a string, it
is interpreted as the URI.  If it is a list, it should be a property
list whose currently only defined key is :uri.
