;;; init.el --- Startup file for Emacs.  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Copyright (C) 2017 Jerry Peng

;; Author: Jerry Peng <pr2jerry@gmail.com>

;;; Commentary:

;; The init system and the config structure are based on Chris
;; Barrett's amazing work: https://github.com/chrisbarrett/.emacs.d

;; Declares some variables and bootstraps the rest of the configuration.
;;
;; One main difference from other configurations out there is that I use git subtrees for
;; many core packages, instead of relying on the Emacs package manager.

;;; Code:

(setq gc-cons-threshold (* 800 1024))

(defconst emacs-start-time (current-time))

(unless noninteractive
  (message "Loading %s..." load-file-name))

;; Initialize package.el
;;
;; Most packages are installed using git subtrees, but some packages (such as
;; flycheck) break unless installed via package.el.
